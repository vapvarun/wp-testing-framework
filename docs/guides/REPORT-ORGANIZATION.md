# Report Organization Guide

## Overview

All reports generated by the WP Testing Framework are organized in plugin-specific folders for better management and AI-readability.

## Directory Structure

```
wp-testing-framework/
└── reports/
    ├── buddypress/           # BuddyPress plugin reports
    │   ├── analysis/         # Code analysis reports
    │   ├── api/             # REST API test reports
    │   ├── coverage/        # Test coverage reports
    │   ├── execution/       # Test execution results
    │   ├── integration/     # Integration test reports
    │   ├── performance/     # Performance test reports
    │   ├── security/        # Security scan reports
    │   └── README.md        # Plugin report index
    │
    ├── woocommerce/         # WooCommerce plugin reports
    │   └── (same structure as above)
    │
    └── [plugin-name]/       # Other plugin reports
        └── (same structure as above)
```

## Report Categories

### 1. Analysis Reports (`/analysis/`)
- Component scanning results
- Code structure analysis
- Feature detection reports
- Dependency analysis

### 2. API Reports (`/api/`)
- REST API endpoint testing
- API parity analysis
- API documentation
- Response validation

### 3. Coverage Reports (`/coverage/`)
- Test coverage statistics
- Missing test identification
- Coverage comparison reports
- Gap analysis

### 4. Execution Reports (`/execution/`)
- Test run results
- Pass/fail statistics
- Execution plans
- Runtime logs

### 5. Integration Reports (`/integration/`)
- Component integration tests
- Workflow analysis
- End-to-end test results
- User journey reports

### 6. Performance Reports (`/performance/`)
- Load testing results
- Benchmark comparisons
- Memory usage analysis
- Query optimization reports

### 7. Security Reports (`/security/`)
- Vulnerability scans
- Security audit results
- Permission analysis
- Input validation reports

## Naming Convention

All reports follow this naming pattern:
```
{plugin}-{type}-{timestamp}.{format}
```

Examples:
- `buddypress-analysis-2025-08-23_14-30-00.json`
- `woocommerce-api-2025-08-23_15-00-00.md`
- `elementor-coverage-2025-08-23_16-00-00.html`

## Using the Report Organizer

### PHP Usage

```php
use WPTestingFramework\Utilities\ReportOrganizer;

// Initialize for a specific plugin
$organizer = new ReportOrganizer('buddypress');

// Get report path
$report_path = $organizer->get_report_path();

// Save a report
$organizer->save_report($content, 'analysis-report.json');

// Get plugin report statistics
$stats = $organizer->get_plugin_report_stats('buddypress');
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Organize existing reports
php tools/utilities/report-organizer.php

# Create structure for a new plugin
php tools/utilities/report-organizer.php --plugin=woocommerce

# Get report statistics
php tools/utilities/report-organizer.php --stats --plugin=buddypress
```

## Scanner Integration

All scanners should use the ReportOrganizer class:

```php
class MyPluginScanner extends UniversalPluginScanner {
    
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct('My Plugin', '/path/to/plugin');
    }
    
    public function scan() {
        // Perform scanning...
        
        // Save with proper organization
        $this->save_results('analysis');  // Saves to /reports/my-plugin/analysis/
    }
}
```

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Plugin Isolation**: Each plugin's reports are completely separated
2. **Category Clarity**: Reports are organized by type for easy navigation
3. **AI Optimization**: Structured format is easily parsed by AI systems
4. **Historical Tracking**: Timestamped reports allow trend analysis
5. **Easy Cleanup**: Old reports can be managed per category
6. **Cross-Reference**: Reports can reference each other within plugin context

## Automated Features

### Auto-Organization
- Reports are automatically moved to correct folders
- Plugin detection from filename patterns
- Category assignment based on report type

### Auto-Indexing
- README.md automatically updated in each plugin folder
- Statistics tracked for each plugin
- Latest report information maintained

### Auto-Cleanup (Configurable)
- Reports older than 90 days can be archived
- Maximum reports per category can be enforced
- Cleanup notifications sent when triggered

## Best Practices

1. **Always use plugin-specific folders** - Never save reports in the root reports/ directory
2. **Use consistent naming** - Follow the timestamp pattern for all reports
3. **Include metadata** - Add generation date, version, and context to reports
4. **Update indexes** - Ensure README.md files are current
5. **Regular cleanup** - Archive old reports to maintain performance

## Configuration

Edit `config/report-structure.json` to:
- Add new plugin configurations
- Modify report categories
- Adjust cleanup settings
- Configure automation rules

## For AI/Claude Code

This organization ensures:
- **Predictable paths**: Reports are always in expected locations
- **Structured data**: JSON format with consistent schema
- **Easy discovery**: Index files list all available reports
- **Context preservation**: Plugin-specific organization maintains context
- **Efficient parsing**: Structured folders reduce search complexity

## Examples

### BuddyPress Reports Location
```
reports/buddypress/
├── analysis/
│   ├── buddypress-component-analysis-2025-08-23_10-00-00.json
│   └── buddypress-advanced-features-2025-08-23_11-00-00.md
├── coverage/
│   ├── buddypress-test-coverage-2025-08-23_12-00-00.json
│   └── buddypress-missing-tests-2025-08-23_13-00-00.md
└── README.md
```

### Report Index (README.md)
Each plugin folder contains an auto-generated README.md with:
- Report statistics
- List of all reports by category
- Latest report information
- File sizes and dates

This organization system ensures all reports are properly structured for both human review and AI analysis.
