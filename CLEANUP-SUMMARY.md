## 📈 Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Organization** - Files now in correct folders
2. **Cleaner Structure** - Removed temporary test artifacts
3. **Consolidated Errors** - All error contexts in one file
4. **Updated Index** - FILE-INDEX.md reflects current state
5. **Full Backup** - Can recover anything if needed
