## Recommended Actions

### 1. Archive One-Time Scripts
```bash
mkdir -p archive/tools
mv tools/utilities/*.php archive/tools/
```

### 2. Remove Outdated Scripts
```bash
rm tools/scanners/scan-wp.sh
rm tools/scan-bp.sh
rm tools/scan-buddypress.sh
rm tools/run-component-tests.sh
```

### 3. Clean AI Tools
```bash
rm tools/ai/simple-plan-plus.mjs
rm tools/ai/generate-tests.mjs  # Duplicate of universal-test-generator
```

## What Each Tool Does

### Essential Tools (Keep)
1. **universal-workflow.mjs** - Orchestrates entire test workflow
2. **AI tools** - Analyze code and generate tests
3. **Documentation tools** - Professional validation and enhancement
4. **PHP AST analyzer** - Accurate PHP code analysis
5. **Coverage reports** - Track test coverage
6. **Security scanner** - Find vulnerabilities
7. **Performance profiler** - Test performance
8. **Demo data generator** - Create test data

### Removed/Archived
1. **Shell scripts** - Replaced by npm commands
2. **Reorganization scripts** - One-time use, job done
3. **Duplicate tools** - Functionality exists elsewhere
